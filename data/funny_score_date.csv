13,"Since I'm sure a lot of people are thinking ""bullshit"" to your response, here are some answers to frequently asked questions:

1.  *""Why does it only work with* ***Diet*** *Coke if it's not a chemical reaction?""*   It does work with other sodas, but you are a dick if you use regular soda, since the mess is going to be way stickier.  Aspartame, the sweetener used in Diet Coke is WAY more sweet than sugar, so a significantly less amount is used.  A side bonus is that less sugar = more water = higher CO2 solubility.

2.  *""Why does it have to be Mentos?""*  It doesn't have to be Mentos, it has to be anything with a high surface area.  Mentos is designed to dissolve quickly in order to freshen your breath faster (and make you eat more Mentos).  Any material with a high surface area will do the exact same thing, the problem is that we don't often run into materials with such a ridiculous surface area, and most of those are materials you don't necessarily want to be spraying all over your friends.

3.  *""Why is it so fast if it's not a chemical reaction?  Most physical reactions are either slow or generate enormous amounts of heat""*  Supersaturation is not an energetically favorable composition.  The reason the process is so slow without the Mentos is because plastic is relatively smooth (low nucleation sites) and the amount of soda exposed to the atmosphere is low.  Since Mentos is more dense than water, it sinks through the soda while breaking up into small chunks, creating nucleation sites everywhere.  If you want another example of a nucleation-based physical reaction, remove the glass plate from your microwave and nuke a glass of water using a brand new glass.  As soon as you touch it, it will flash boil and burn your dumbass hands.",0,22,10

First of all, how much is the equipment worth - and how much is the data being stored on it worth? And what are your backup policies?

Also, if you care to share any details about what kinds of computers these are, and how fibrous the dust is, that'd be great!

##Types of dust and cleaning:

The sort of dust least prone to buildup is that along the lines of [sand and concrete dust](http://i.imgur.com/DuzvJZK.jpg) - But there is also potential for moisture to accumulate when you build up a lot of fine, granular dust. Especially in humid conditions, or cold warehouses in hot areas (condensation rich conditions). And this can cause arching in places like the PSU and in some cases on the motherboard by capacitors or power cables. This is also the easiest type of dust to clean, since you can basically just gently shake it out. Do turn off the computer first, though. Mechanical harddrives don't like shaking during operation.

Then we have the [very fine types of dust](http://i.imgur.com/TTa2OpS.jpg) (Additional: [ONE](http://i.imgur.com/FLahWm7.jpg), [TWO](http://i.imgur.com/y4X6mwz.jpg), [THREE](http://i.imgur.com/pIYtV9c.jpg)) - This will usually form in spaces that *seem* clean. And normally it'll take a long time, but depending on what sort of contaminating materials you have around, it can happen very fast, too. It's probably the hardest to clean. Blow it out like described below, and then go at it with something like a kitchen towel, or a large, soft brush. Don't use things like dusters or dusting cloth. Those are static nightmares.

Next there's your [regular kind of home dust](http://i.imgur.com/eRFYMJv.jpg), that builds up in grey fluffballs. This will clog your heatsinks over time, and cause the system to run hotter. But it isn't very prone to causing acute damage, like short circuiting. To clean it - First you need to make sure your system is off, and then you use some form of blower (as opposed to a vacuum cleaner) to prevent static buildup. And basically, you just blow the dust out. You can pick out large pieces with your hands, too. Very basic stuff. Some people worry about fans spinning when you're blowing air at them, and producing electrical current, but this isn't really something you need to worry about.

Then there's [highly fibrous dust](http://i.imgur.com/3cigjup.jpg) - This is the fastest form to build up. The longer fibers that are usually the result of things like pets or people who shed a lot of hair easily get stuck on meshes and heatinks, and other dust starts to accumilate *very* quickly. But there's the positive of usually being able to grab a large lump of dust with your fingers, and pull it out in one go. Yay for easy cleaning!

There are also some highly conditional forms of dust like [short fiber wool dust](http://i.imgur.com/zGqhflU.jpg) found in a clothing store, or this guy who seems to have encountered [dust rich in vehicular exhaust particles](http://i.imgur.com/z1CFNSH.jpg). 

But worst of all, there's [smoker's dust](http://i.imgur.com/CwNoUF4.jpg). What is shown in this picture would be a mild case - people who smoke even a few cigarettes a day near their computers will have their machines looking vile pretty quickly. This form of dust is abhorrent. It absolutely reeks, and it's not powdery in the slightest. It's like it has been caked on, and it has a thick tar-like consistency. This is one of the few cases where I'd recommend taking the heatsink off, just to make cleaning easier. 

##Preventative methods and cleaning:

The easiest and cheapest way to slow down the buildup of dust in your computer is to move it off the floor. Just putting it on a bench or desk instead of underneath it works miracles. Also consider how much dust there is in that particular area of the warehouse, and if you might consider moving the computers to a near by room and running cables to access points if you need them. 

Next, look at how your fans are positioned. As a general rule of thumb you want fans blowing in from the front and bottom, and out through the top and back for the coolest system. But many computers don't come with an intake fan, and that leaves your computer pulling in dust through all the various holes. In this case you might want to consider buying some cheap fans, or moving the fans in the system from an exhaust position to an intake one. 

Then you want to look at dust filters. They're relatively cheap, and very good at collecting dust. You simply put them in front of any intake fans/holes, and any type of mesh facing upwards. Keep in mind that although a regular computer in a home might only be worth dusting out once a year or so, and a computer in a work environment like a warehouse might best be cleaned lightly every 6 months, a dust filter will build up dust much faster. But with a dust filter, all you need to do is wipe it off every 3-6 months, and you might not have to clean the rest of the computer more often than every year or two.

Cleaning, like mentioned above, is done primarily with things like compressed air canisters, reusable computer dusters (filled with hand or electric pump), or other forms of blowers. You can also use things like paint brushes and cloth, but avoid using stuff that will break down like paper towels. And at all costs avoid things that produce large amounts of static electricity.  

If you're working in a specialty environment like a bakery that deals with things like flour or sugar, or a saw mill or whatever else that is prone to *extreme* amounts of particles I would be happy to give some pointers on dust mitigation procedures. Or consult on a special solution within your budget. ",21,28,2

Although part of the reason he did the T Shirt thing was because their booming success at the time was freaking him out, so I think in some way he hoped this might mitigate it somehow. He also made a mockery out of the Top Of The Pops show in the UK because they forced them to mime, so Cobain decided to sing it in the style of Morrissey, the hilarious result is here:  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0MzeMfcGxA  

He also had some falling out with MTV over something, I can't remember the story. But when it came to them playing the huge Video Music Awards show.... [pasted from  wiki]    

Nirvana had wanted to play ""Rape Me"" during its performance at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. While MTV initially told the band they could play any song they wanted, the network later insisted that the group play ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" instead. Hours before the show, Nirvana refused to play. However, due to concerns that the network could boycott other artists on the group's label if the group refused to play the show, Nirvana ultimately settled on performing its then-latest single ""Lithium"". At the start of the performance, Cobain started playing and singing ""Rape Me"" instead; he said he did so ""just to give [MTV] a little heart palpitation"". Panicked, MTV was moments away from switching from the live performance to a commercial when the band stopped playing ""Rape Me"" and started playing ""Lithium"".

43,"&gt; The third option is to just accept it, roll your eyes, and move on with the real problems of the world.

Yep.

This has already happened with ""moron"", ""idiot"", etc.  They were previously terms that were used to describe the mentally incompetent (which may be another no-no phrase, but hey, whatever - you get my meaning).  Their usage eventually changed into something more common, e.g., ""I was such an idiot"", ""Don't be an idiot"", etc., and were no longer used to describe people who actually have medical dysfunctions - to do so would be incredibly rude.

Now the exact same thing is happening, just with a new word.  We don't call people with a mental handicap ""retarded"".  You'd be a huge jerkwad if you did.  Just as if you'd called them a ""moron"".

If someone uses the word ""idiot"", but has a problem with people using ""retarded"" in the same context, they really don't have a leg to stand on to defend their reasoning.

Now, if someone was dead against the usage of ""dumb"", ""moron"", ""idiot"", ""imbecile"", ""cretin"", ""dolt"", and ""retard"" equally and intended to banish each and every one of them from our speech, then they'd have a position with some real footing.
